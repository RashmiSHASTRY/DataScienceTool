Assignments on Data science tool course 

Data science can be defined as a blend of mathematics, business acumen, tools, algorithms and machine learning techniques,

all of which help us in finding out the hidden insights or patterns from raw data which can be of major use in the formation of big business decisions.

In data science, one deals with both structured and unstructured data. The algorithms also involve predictive analytics in them.

Thus, data science is all about the present and future. That is, finding out the trends based on historical data which can be useful for present decisions 

and finding patterns which can be modelled and can be used for predictions to see what things may look like in the future.

Data Science is an amalgamation of Statistics, Tools and Business knowledge. So, it becomes imperative for a Data Scientist to have good knowledge and understanding of these.
